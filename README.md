# Air Pollution

Project carried out as part of the subject [*Programming in Erlang*](https://syllabuskrk.agh.edu.pl/2017-2018/en/magnesite/study_plans/stacjonarne-informatyka/module/iin-1-416-s-zimowy-programming-in-erlang).

In the project, the ***pollution*** module was created, whose task is to store and process data collected from air quality measuring stations. The project is based on gen_server behaviour, which is implemented in ***pollution_server*** and ***pollution_supervisor*** modules. For this modules, adequate tests were written. The ***pollution_data*** module is written in Elixir, and allows to parse data from csv file.
